# Exploit-Functions

Ok, you read the title, Exploit Functions for your dll source.

1: if it errors, i am sorry but you are skidding, learn cpp and fix it.

2: paste this anywhere in your  dll source (main is cool as well).

before you say the functions are skidded, remember, i don't
know who's this is, it was in my old dll source, anyway enjoy
